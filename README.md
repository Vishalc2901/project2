# Coronavirus Probability Detector - Deployment using Azure Web Apps
## Project Demo URL : 

![Python 3.8.5](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3.8-blue) 

•This repository consists of files required to deploy a **Web App** created with **Flask on Microsoft Azure**. Coronavirus Probability Detector The project helps the user to identify whether someone is infected by corona virus by simply inputting certain values like Fever Value, Age, Body Pain , Runny Nose, Breathing Difficulty etc. with the help of a database.

By using the statistical data about how certain aspects like Fever Value, Age, Body Pain , Runny Nose, Breathing Difficulty etc. Impact if an individual is infected by covid 19 or not, the project will be able to tell the user if the person has infected or not by entering those values. So in a way the project will help in monitoring the likelihood of someone developing infection. The project can be extended to include other diseases prediction which I will incorporate later down the road.

### Problem Statement/Oppurtunity:
 As we know that the whole world is affected by the coronavirus. In this we have make a **“Coronavirus Probability Detector”** using **python and machine learning** concepts. This project is very different yet helpful for all of us in such a pandemic situation.

## Project Discription:
 Machine learning techniques Provide better result for prediction by con- structing models from datasets collected from patients. In this work we will use Machine Learning Classification and ensemble techniques on a dataset to predict infection probability. Which are K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Logistic Regression (LR), Decision Tree (DT), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Gradient Boosting (GB) and Random Forest (RF). The accuracy is different for every model when compared to other models. The Project work gives the accurate or higher accuracy model shows that the model is capable of predicting infection effectively. Our Result shows that Random Forest achieved higher accuracy compared to other machine learning techniques. The is a Microsoft Azure Web App project that helps the user to identify whether someone is suffering from covid infection by simply inputting certain values like Fever Value, Age, Body Pain , Runny Nose, Breathing Difficulty etc. with the help of database.

## Primary Ajure Technology:
**Azure Web Apps , AI+Machine Learning, Computer Vision, Static Web Apps, Web Apps**

## Conclusion:
This machine learning model is trained on the data to find out the probability of a person having the COVID-19 infection.
